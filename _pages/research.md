### Working Papers
- **“Education Migration in China” (Job Market Paper) ** with [Lin Ma](https://lin-ma.com/index.html)

**Abstract:** Educational resources are generally distributed unevenly across space. Within an individual's lifespan, the decision regarding education ranks among the most crucial, determining whether to pursue higher education and where to pursue it. In this paper, we develop a dynamic spatial model to endogenize the educational decision, allowing individuals to migrate within a country in search of either work or educational opportunities. Our quantitative model mirrors China’s economy, addressing the policy question of the government’s investment in higher education institutes. We estimate the cost of obtaining education in each location and simulate college expansion. Counterfactual exercises demonstrate that the unevenly distributed resources largely suppress talents in less education resource-abundant places, leading to a 3% lower skill ratio compared to otherwise equally distributed resources.

- **“(Trade) War and Peace: How Can International Sanctions Be Imposed Most Cost Efficiently?”** with [Gustavo de Souza](https://gustavodesouza.net), [Haishi Li](https://sites.google.com/view/haishi-harry-li/home), and [Yuan Mei](https://sites.google.com/site/meiyecon/home), 2023. **R&R Journal of Monetary Economics.**
  
**Abstract:** Trade sanctions are a common instrument of diplomatic retaliation. To guide current and future policy, we ask: What is the most cost-efficient way to impose trade sanctions against Russia? To answer this question, we build a quantitative model of international trade with input-output connections. Sanctioning countries simultaneously choose import tariffs to maximize their welfare (measured with real income) and to minimize Russia’s welfare, with different weights placed on these objectives. We find, first, the sanctioning countries can cause moderate economic damage in Russia, with Russian welfare falling 1.3% to 2.9%, depending on whether Russia retaliates or not. Second, for countries with a small willingness to pay for sanctions against Russia, the most cost-efficient sanction is a uniform, about 20% tariff against all Russian products. Third, if the European Union (EU) is willing to pay at least US$0.67 for each US$1 drop in Russian welfare, an embargo on Russia’s mining and energy sector products and about 50% tariffs on all other imports from Russia is the most cost-efficient policy. Finally, if countries target politically relevant sectors, a global embargo against Russia’s mining and energy sector is the cost-efficient policy even when there is a small willingness to pay for sanctions.
